# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop several predictive models for used car prices. We used a dataset with features such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, and engine size, to uncover patterns and relationships influencing the pricing of used cars.

## The Dataset

The original dataset had been extracted from 100,000 used car listings and then organized into individual files corresponding to each distinct car manufacturer. 

## Data Cleaning

* The separate files were pooled into a unified dataset and included an extra column to specify the car's make.

* A check was conducted for any missing values. 

* A quick statistical analysis was run using .describe() to spot outliers and potential errors. 

* The refined dataset was then saved into a fresh CSV for easy access.
