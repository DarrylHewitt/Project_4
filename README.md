# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop several predictive models for used car prices. We used a dataset with features such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, and engine size, to uncover patterns and relationships influencing the pricing of used cars.

## The Dataset 

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes 

The original dataset had been extracted from 100,000 used car listings and then organized into individual files corresponding to each distinct car manufacturer. 

## Data Cleaning

* The separate files were pooled into a unified dataset and an additional column was included specifying the car's make.

* A check was conducted for any missing values.

* A quick statistical analysis was run using .describe() to spot outliers and potential errors.

* The refined dataset was then saved into a fresh CSV for easy access.

## The Database

A SQLite database was used to store the dataset. The data from the CSV file was read into a Pandas DataFrame and then committed to a newly-created SQLite database.

To get a better idea of the data set we used a correlation matrix.

Before building any machine learning model we looked at which variables are correlated, to can gain a better understanding about whatâ€™s most important for our models.

Price measure against engine size and year of the car showed a positive relationship.

Price measure against mpg and mileage showed a negative relationship.

To enhance the representation of data variation, a violin plot was employed. Notably, both automatic and semi-auto transmissions exhibit higher mean prices, accompanied by instances of extreme prices. The make of the car is also a critical factor in this analysis

Predicting Car Prices with RANSACRegressor
Data Preparation:
Extracted features (X) from 'cars_sold_df,' excluding the 'price' column.
Set the target variable (y) to the 'price' column.
Handling Categorical Variables:
Identified and one-hot encoded categorical columns in X.
Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Ensured reproducibility with random_state=42.
Model Initialization and Training:
Initialized a RANSACRegressor model with a maximum of 100 trials.
Trained the model on the training data.
Result:
Obtained a trained RANSACRegressor model capable of predicting car prices, considering potential outliers.

Model Training:
Used RANSACRegressor with default settings on the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation:
Made predictions on the testing set.
Evaluated using metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2.
Results:
Predicted car prices on the testing set and key evaluation metrics.
Interpretation:
Interpreted metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2 for understanding model performance.

Check Data Sizes:
Displayed sizes of the testing set and corresponding target variable.
Outcome:
Effectively demonstrated the model's handling of outliers through visualized results.

## Decision Tree

* The 'price' column was separated as the target variable ('y'), and the remaining columns were used as features ('X').
  
* The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

* Standard scaling was applied to the features using StandardScaler to normalize the data.

* A Decision Tree Regressor model was created with the parameters: `Max_Depth = 15` and `random_state = 0`.

* Once the model was trained and used to predict the test values, the model results were:
  * R2 Score = 0.93
  * MSE = 6128960.49

## Random Forest Regression

* The 'price' column was separated as the target variable ('y'), and the remaining columns were used as features ('X').
  
* The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

* Standard scaling was applied to the features using StandardScaler to normalize the data.

* A Random Forest Regressor was trained on the scaled training data with specified hyperparameters (50 estimators, max depth of 15).

* The R-squared score was calculated on the scaled test data, resulting in a high value of 0.95, indicating a good fit. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was also calculated, yielding a value of approximately 4.95 million.

* The model was used to make predictions on the test set, and a DataFrame was created to compare predicted and actual values.

* The importance of each feature in making predictions was determined using the Random Forest model, and the top 10 features were identified.

## Reflections/Evaluation

* If we had the opportunity to repeat this project, we would use live API data to build the model on real-time data

* Additionally, we could have used the mean squared error metric across all models to work out absolute error. 

* It would also be good to use cross validation techniques to help gauge how well the model works with unseen data
